# FDM Employee Portal  

## **Project Overview**  
The **FDM Employee Portal Project** was developed as part of a **Software Engineering project** to create a secure and efficient web-based platform for employee management. The portal allows employees to **share and discuss information**, stay updated with company announcements, and perform self-service tasks such as **annual leave booking and personal information updates**.

Given that many **FDM employees are consultants working remotely on client sites**, this platform plays a crucial role in **keeping employees connected** and **ensuring smooth HR operations**.

This project was developed by a team of **six students** following **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) best practices**, from planning and design to implementation, testing, and deployment.

## **Key Features**  
✔ **User Authentication** – Secure **token-based authentication (JWT)** for login and access control.  
✔ **Blog Section** – Employees can **share posts, view updates, and engage with company content**.  
✔ **Employee Management** – Manage **user accounts, teams, and roles**.  
✔ **Leave Request System** – Employees can **submit leave requests**, and managers can **approve or reject them**.  
✔ **Payslip Management** – Employees can securely **view and download their payslips**.  
✔ **Self-Service Functionalities** – Employees can **update their personal information**.  
✔ **Admin Panel** – HR and management can **manage users, teams, and clients** efficiently.
